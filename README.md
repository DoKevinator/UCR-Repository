UCR-Repository
==============

All my source code for school projects/assignments at University of California, Riverside. 

For all of those who are interested in the kind of assignments or projects I do in school.
Please DO NOT plagiarize. 
It is not my responsibility if you are caught in academic dishonesty. 
This is for my convenience and for others to learn. 

This repository was active from the years 2012 to 2014. I transferred to UC Irvine in 2014.
